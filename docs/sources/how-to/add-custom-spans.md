# How to add custom spans in your code

This guide shows you how to trace your own code by opening spans from an add-on or project.
Use it when a request spends time in code that plone.observability does not already instrument, and you want that time to show up in your traces.

For the helper signature, see {doc}`/reference/tracing`.

## Open a span around your code

Import `start_span` and wrap the work in a `with` block.

```python
from plone.observability.spans import start_span


def rebuild_report(items):
    with start_span("myaddon.rebuild_report"):
        for item in items:
            process(item)
```

The span nests automatically under whatever span is currently active, usually the `ZPublisher.publish` span for the request.
It appears in your trace backend as a child, with its own start time and duration.

## Attach attributes

Pass a dictionary of attributes to record context alongside the span.

```python
with start_span("myaddon.rebuild_report", {"myaddon.item_count": len(items)}):
    for item in items:
        process(item)
```

Keep attribute values bounded in the same way you keep metric labels bounded: a count or a category is fine, an unbounded id list is not.

## Add attributes or events during the span

`start_span` yields the span object, so you can enrich it as the work proceeds.
Without the `opentelemetry` extra installed the helper yields `None`, so guard any use of the yielded value.

```python
with start_span("myaddon.rebuild_report") as span:
    result = run()
    if span is not None:
        span.set_attribute("myaddon.rows_written", result.rows)
```

## Nest spans

Spans opened inside another `start_span` block nest under it, so you can break a large operation into named phases.

```python
with start_span("myaddon.import"):
    with start_span("myaddon.import.parse"):
        data = parse(source)
    with start_span("myaddon.import.store"):
        store(data)
```

## Leave it in production code

`start_span` is dependency-optional: when the `opentelemetry` extra is not installed it is a no-op context manager that yields `None`.
You can call it unconditionally in shipped code without adding a hard dependency on OpenTelemetry, and it costs nothing when tracing is off.

Name your spans with a stable, low-cardinality prefix such as your add-on name, for example `myaddon.import.store`.
Never put ids or other unbounded values in the span name.
